# Hello, i'm Yev ðŸ‘‹

My full name is ***Evgeniy Nekrasov***, but everyoone just call me ***Yev***. I was
born in [Kyrgyzstan](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirguist%C3%A1n) and have been 
chasing pixels, ideas, and new horizonts evere since.


### First Byte - Kyrgyzstan, early 2000s
Picture a **Pentium II**, a 10-12 year old boy, and the unmistakable screech of a 56k
modem connection...

***HERE NOICE***

I played a couple of DOS games, doodled in [**MS Paint**](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint),
and didn't event think how all of these is working. Just was enjoing the content. 

### CafÃ© clicks - Bulgaria 2003
My family moved to Bulgaria, and my only computer time was in smoky cybercafÃ©s whatever
my friends and i battled demons in [**Diablo II**](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_II).
School somehow skipped IT classes altogether, so computers stayed a hobby, not a subject.

### New life - Spain, 2007
Next stop, Spain. High school 'informatics' arrived just as i was still decoding Spanish language,
so very little stuck. I shelved tech and explored everething else - studying **Fine arts** in Bulgaria,  **Ephemeral Architecture**,
**Product Design** in Spain, and working every job from waiter to over-land freight traffic manager.

### The accidental "Hello World"
Fast-forward to the COVID-19 lockdown. Over coffe with a friend, the questrion dropped:
***Ever tried programming?***
I hadn't, by why no? I installed [Python](https://www.python.org/), opened a [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), and typed:

```Python
print("Hello World")
```

I was not love from first sign xD - every tiny change broke my things and the syntax 
felt alien. But curiosity make people send and machine to Mars and i keeped poking
around xD.

### Butterflies in the Browser
The spark came when i touched front-end code. A scrappy bit of HTML, some bvery broken CSS,
and a one-line main.js

```js
console.log("this is a string");
```

Suddenly the browser responded, and i felt those "butterflies in the stomach". Ideas 
flooded in faster that i could type.

### Bootcamp to backlog
I dove into a bootcamp and just in time i finished it i landed my first role as a 
**develop/designer**. Now i'm sampling every tech stack i can find-C, Rust, C#, Assembly,
EcmaScript, and much more xD Love evertything.

## Why this blog exist
This space is my digital lab note:
- Experiments that works (and plenty that don't)
- Note on tools, languages, and workflows
- Reflections
- Resources i wish someone had handled me on day one.

If you're a curious soul, a career-changer, or just nostalgic for the hiss 
of dial-up, you'll feel right at home here. Thanks for reading.

- Yev
